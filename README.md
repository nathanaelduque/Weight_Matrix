<h1 align="center"> Weight_Matrix Package </h1>

 This package was created in order to speed up the work of people dealing with Distributed Systems or Multiagents Systems , since in order to create a 
distributed optimization algorithm commonly we have to represent them by Adjacency matrices or Weight matrices. This package has the most common formulas that are used to transform a Adjacency Matrix into a Weight Matrix. It has the following formulas:

* Averaging Rule ( it is called as Averaging_Rule)
* Hasting Rule( it is called as Hasting_Rules) 
* Relative degree rule (it is called as Relative_degree_rule)
* Mean Metropolis rule (it is called as Mean_Metropolis) 

You can use this package downloading this repository into your machine or simply tiping this in your terminal console:
 ```python
pip install Weight_Matrix
```
**Feel free to give feedback or suggestions**

## Future Development: 
 In the Future, this package will receive the number of players communicating in the  network  and the type of network you want. And it will return the Adjacency Matrix and the Weight Matrix.
